# Clock_Ver1
A Visual Studio C# Project that shows a Clock of your current time, allows you to use a Stopwatch, and also lets you set a Timer!
To increase the interest and the fun, the Clock comes with two appearances: The ordinary clock with hands, or the clock that runs with circular progress bars.

**HOW TO USE**
You can use this program very similarly to the Clock app on your phone.
1. TIMER: Type in your desired time span, and let the timer count down. You can pause the timer and continue later, or stop it completely at any time.
2. CLOCK: You can look at the time on this clock in 2 versions: With clockhands, or without clockhands (Cirular progress bars version). It also shows you the date and time in hh:mm:ss am/pm fashion.
3. STOPWATCH: Press Start to start the stopwatch. You can see your laps displayed in the log on the right. You can pause the stopwath to continue later, or stop it completely at any time.
